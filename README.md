# 👋 Hey there, I'm Loui Bénas, also known as TechDevOnGithub!

🌍 I'm a graphics developer from Germany specializing in real-time computer graphics with a heavy focus on user interaction. My goal is to improve current methodologies in the field and make learning about computer graphics more accessible to everyone.

🚀 Founder of **Aurealis Graphics**, where I focus on innovation and creativity in the software industry.

🎮 I develop shader packs for **Minecraft: Java Edition**, including:
- **Prism**: A research-based pathtracing shader pack.
- **Lux**: A high-fidelity shader pack inspired by Capt Tatsu's BSL Shaders, tailored for mid-to-high-end users.

💻 Besides graphics development, I also explore game, software, and web development from time to time.

🎶 In my free time, I enjoy making the computer go bleep bloop, working on music, drinking coffee to keep myself alive, and playing with my cat ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ.

📈 Check out my projects and contributions, and let’s connect to explore the world of graphics together!
