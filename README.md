### Hey there, I'm Tech~ 👋

## I am a graphics developer and programming enthusiast!
Hey, I'm Tech (aka Lunéo), a selftaught developer and music producer from Germany 🇩🇪 <br>
I specialize in graphics development but I am also looking into <br>
game-/software- and web-development from time to time 👾

In my freetime I mostly make the computer go bleep bloop, work on music <br>
drink coffee to keep myself alive and play with my cat :3

### Languages and Tools I use:
<details>
    <summary>☕️ Java</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java was the first language I learned properly. The only <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use that I currently have for it though, is Minecraft Spigot Plugins / Forge Mods.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>✨ GLSL</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I do 80% of the time when programming is graphics development. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaders (or Minecraft shaders in particular) always fascinated me <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so that is what I am specialising in, which I obviously have to either use GLSL or HLSL for.

<details>
    <summary>⚙️ Rust</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fairly new to Rust but really enjoy it! <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being done with game prototyping in Unity, I write my games in<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rust alongside my very barebones rust game engine.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>🌎 HTML / CSS / JS</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... I use it for web stuff ig?
</details>

<details>
    <summary>🔪 C#</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use C# mainly for game prototyping in Unity.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>⚡️ Electron</summary>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's what I use for nearly anything related to <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;software development. Since I am fairly confident in my full stack <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;web development skills, working with Electron works like a charm for me.
